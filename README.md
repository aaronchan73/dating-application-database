# Dating Application Database

The domain of our application is a dating application, and will focus on the data that is stored in the various components and features that make up a dating application. 

The aspects of the domain will include the user information (such as email and password), profile (free or premium), photos, preferences, description, other social media sites, and matches that the user makes with other profiles, with the associated chat messages. 

Our database allows companies (such as popular dating applications like Tinder or Hinge) to keep track of dating profiles and their associated features and the ratio 
between free and premium profile users.  

On the companyâ€™s side, this benefits the company as it allows them easy access when storing data for their own application and using the data to potentially develop an algorithm that recommends certain matches to a user. Furthermore, the data count also helps determine whether the premium account type is effective through revenue trends. 

The functionality of dating applications focuses entirely on the user. One of the primary features of a user is the ability to have access and create a profile through an authentication login system, and storing the various matches that a user makes (and the chat that interacts with the associated match). Other functionalities include a profile description, photos that are displayed for other users to view (accessible by a photo url (purl)), and the type of profile that is created - either free or premium, with premium containing preferences on what the user wishes to be matched with. The user can as well link other social media accounts to their profile which can be accessed by other users via a social url (surl).

This project will be done using HTML for the front-end UI of the application, Oracle as DBMS, and PHP to connect the database with the front-end. We do not anticipate any special hardware.
